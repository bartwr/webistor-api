Whoops
======

Someone has just filled in your email address into the "I forgot my password"
part of http://webistor.net/. If that wasn't you then you can forget about this email
(though trying out Webistor can't hurt, it's pretty cool).

You do not yet have an account associated with this email address at Webistor.
Maybe you've registerred under a different email address, or maybe you just
really want to be a part of Webistor!

As with every one of our emails, just hit reply and we'll respond right away! :)
