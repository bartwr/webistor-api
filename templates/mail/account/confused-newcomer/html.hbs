          Someone has just filled in your email address into the "I forgot my password"
          part of <a href="http://webistor.net/">Webistor</a>. If that wasn't you then
          you can forget about this email (though trying out Webistor can't hurt, it's
          pretty cool).
        </p>

        <p>
          You do not yet have an account associated with this email address at Webistor.
          Maybe you've registerred under a different email address, or maybe you just
          really want to be a part of Webistor!
