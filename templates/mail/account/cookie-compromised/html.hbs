        <p>
          It seems you visited Webistor with an expired authentication cookie (created by the
          "keep me logged-in" check box). This cookie might have expired because some one
          else has used it to gain access to your account illegally.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your account has been logged out from all computers, therefore the attacker will no longer
          have access to the account. The attacker should not have been able to change your password
          because they don't know your old one.
        </p>

        <p>
          To prevent this happening in the future, refrain from using "keep me logged-in" on
          untrusted devices or public wireless networks (like hotspots in caf√©s).
