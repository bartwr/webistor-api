Cookie leak
===========

It seems you visited Webistor with an expired authentication cookie (created by the
"keep me logged-in" check box). This cookie might have expired because some one else has
used it to gain access to your account illegally.

Your account has been logged out from all computers, therefore the attacker will no longer
have access to the account. The attacker should not have been able to change your password
because they don't know your old one.

To prevent this happening in the future, refrain from using "keep me logged-in" on
untrusted devices or public networks (like schools).

Our apologies for any inconveniences this may have caused.
