Webistor has updated
====================

tl;dr

  Webistor has had a big server update and is now much cooler. However, we do need you to
  reset your password for reasons explained below.

What's changed?

  Not good enough. Start over.

    We've rewritten the server software running Webistor from scratch. We've switched from
    using a general PHP framework which wasn't entirely fit for purpose to using a fully
    tailored NodeJS program. We've also made many optimisations in the client application
    in the process of adjusting it to the new server software.

  New features.

    Though most of our time went into creating the new server software, we have spent some
    time to implement new features.

What does this mean for me?

  Speed! Power!

    Having the tailored server software means that there's nothing more happening than
    needed. This has greatly improved server-communication speed. The optimisations made
    in the client application are contributing to a smoother experience. Altogether
    Webistor should be and feel a lot faster!

  Better security.

    The new server employs an array of technologies that should make your account less
    prone to being stolen and the website less prone to being a victim of a cyber-attack.

  Account migration.

    We've migrated your account to the new server, along with all of your tags and
    entries. Any entries you may have had that shared the same URI have been merged
    together, this will affect very few users and should not cause any problems.

    Because the new server uses an improved password hashing algorithm, we couldn't
    migrate your passwords. Therefore we require everyone to do a one-time password reset.

  The new stuff.

    Some of the new features include:

    - Search for a specific tag by including the hash symbol (#) in the search-bar.
    - Recover your lost password.
    - Edit your account details, like user name or password.
