What's changed?

  Rewritten Server Software.

     Webistor has switched from a general PHP framework to a fully tailored NodeJS program.
     Also many optimisations in the client application have been made in the process of
     adjusting it to the new server software.

  New features.

    Alongside creating new server software, we've implemented new features.

      Including:

        - Use # to search for specific tags.
        - Recover your lost password.

  What does this mean for me?

    More speed & power!

      Having the tailored server software means that there's nothing more happening than needed. 
      This has greatly improved server-communication speed. The optimisations made in the client
      application are contributing to a smoother experience. Altogether Webistor should be and
      feel a lot faster!

    Better security.

      The new server employs an array of technologies that should make your account less prone to
      being stolen and the website less prone to being a victim of a cyber-attack.

    Account migration.

      Your account has been migrated to a new server, along with all your data you currently had.
      Any entries you may have had that shared the same URI have been merged together, this will
      affect very few users and should not cause problems.

      Because the new server uses an improved password hashing algorithm, we couldn't migrate passwords.
      Therefor we require everyone to do a one-time password reset.
